# a-star-heuristic-function
This is an implementation of the A star search which uses Heuristic function to find the shortest path in C++. 

I'm currently enrolled in Udacity's C++ nanodegree course

This is an implementation of A-star search algorithm with manhattan distance

> A star search is an algorithm that's majorly used in a path-finding solution for finding the shortest route effectively.

> In this implementation, the admissible function that's incoporated is the Manhattan distance
